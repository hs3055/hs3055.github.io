### Conversational ai therapist for daily function screening in home environments

<sup>**Introduction:** The growth of smart devices is making typical homes more intelligent. In this work, in collaboration with therapists, we introduce a home-based AI therapist that takes advantage of the smart home environment to screen the day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Unlike existing “chatbot” works that identify the mental status of users through conversation, our AI therapist additionally leverages smart devices and sensors throughout the home to infer mental well-being and assesses a user's daily functioning. We propose a series of 37 dimensions of daily functioning, that our system observes through conversing with the user and detecting daily activity events using sensors and smart sensors throughout the home. Our system utilizes these 37 dimensions in conjunction with novel natural language processing architectures to detect abnormalities in mental status (e.g., angry or depressed), well-being, and daily functioning and generate responses to console users when abnormalities are detected. Through a series of user studies, we demonstrate that our system can converse with a user naturally, accurately detect abnormalities in well-being, and provide appropriate responses consoling users.</sup>



### AI Therapist for Daily Functioning Assessment and Intervention using Smart Home Devices

<sup>**Introduction:** In this demonstration, in collaboration with licensed therapists, we introduce an AI therapist that takes advantage of the smart-home environment to screen day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Our system can assess a user’s daily functioning and mental wellness based on a combination of direct conversation with users and information obtained from smart home devices using psychological rubrics proposed in [1]. We demonstrate that our system can converse with a user in a natural way (through a smartphone or smart speaker) and analyze a user’s response semantically and sentimentally. In addition, we show that our system can provide preliminary interventions to help improve the user’s wellness. In particular, when abnormal behavior is detected during the conversation or by smart home devices, the system provides psychotherapeutic consolations during the conversation and will check on the occupant’s condition by actuating a home robot.</sup>

### LLM-based Conversational AI Therapist for Daily Functioning Screening and Psychotherapeutic Intervention via Everyday Smart Devices
<sup>**Despite the global mental health crisis, access to screenings, professionals, and treatments remains high. In collaboration with licensed psychotherapists, we propose a Conversational AI Therapist with psychotherapeutic Interventions (CaiTI), a platform that leverages large language models (LLM)s and smart devices to enable better mental health self-care. CaiTI can screen the day-to-day functioning using natural and psychotherapeutic conversations. CaiTI leverages reinforcement learning to provide personalized conversation flow. CaiTI can accurately understand and interpret user responses. When the user needs further attention during the conversation, CaiTI can provide conversational psychotherapeutic interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). Leveraging the datasets prepared by the licensed psychotherapists, we experiment and microbenchmark various LLMs' performance in tasks along CaiTI's conversation flow and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. With the psychotherapists, we implement CaiTI and conduct 14-day and 24-week studies. The study results, validated by therapists, demonstrate that CaiTI can converse with users naturally, accurately understand and interpret user responses, and provide psychotherapeutic interventions appropriately and effectively. We showcase the potential of CaiTI LLMs to assist the mental therapy diagnosis and treatment and improve day-to-day functioning screening and precautionary psychotherapeutic intervention systems.**</sup>
