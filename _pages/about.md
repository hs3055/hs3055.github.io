I am currently a Licensed Mental Health Counselor at a Private Practice located in New York City. I focus on treating a variety of mental health diagnoses using Evidence-Based Therapy. 

Besides clinical practice, I supervise limited permit holders in Mental Health Counseling...

Before my current commitments, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Psychology from New York University, and two Master's degrees in Psychological Counseling from Teachers College, Columbia University.
