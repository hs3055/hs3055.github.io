I am currently a 2nd-year economics PhD student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interests lie in the fields of applied microeconomics and digital economy, with a focus on microfinance. Before starting my PhD journey, I worked as a product manager at Alibaba Group where I specialized in recommendation system optimization. I also hold a Master's degree in data science from Columbia University which focused on machine learning.
