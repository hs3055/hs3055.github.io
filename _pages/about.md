I am currently a 2nd-year economics PhD student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interests are centered around the fields of applied microeconomics and digital economy, with a focus on microfinance. 

Before my PhD studies, I worked as a product manager at Alibaba Group where I specialized in optimizing recommendation systems. Additionally, I obtained a Master's degree in data science from Fu Foundation Engineering School, Columbia University, with a focus on machine learning.
