I am currently a Licensed Mental Health Counselor at a Private Practice located in New York City. I focus on treating a variety of mental health diagnoses using Evidence-Based Therapy. 

Besides my clinical practice, I supervise and mentor limited permit holders in Mental Health Counseling, I explore the relationship between mental health and automated systems, focusing on how technology like AI and digital tools can impact mental health practices, and I advocate for the wellness of Asian American mental health.

Before my current commitments, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Psychology from New York University, and two Master's degrees in Psychological Counseling from Teachers College, Columbia University. 

I’ve created something really cool—a LaTeX file for treatment planning that mimics the format of Wiley’s treatment plans. This allows you to generate your own treatment plans with a professional, polished look.
